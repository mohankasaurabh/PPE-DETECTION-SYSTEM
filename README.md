# 🚀 Features

## ✅ Real-Time PPE Detection
This project uses a custom-trained YOLOv26s model (`best.pt`) for real-time PPE detection.

The model detects:

- 👷 Person
- 🪖 Helmet
- 🦺 Safety Vest
- 😷 Mask
- ⛑️ Additional PPE Classes
- ❌ Missing PPE Violations

### Base Model

```bash
yolo26s.pt
```

After training:

```bash
best.pt
```

---

# 🧬 Enterprise ReID System (NEW)

## ✅ OSNet Person Re-Identification
The project now includes:

- OSNet-based feature extraction
- Persistent worker identity tracking
- Temporal embedding memory
- Cross-track identity recovery
- Stable worker global IDs

This upgrades the system from:

```text
Basic object tracking
```

into:

```text
Enterprise intelligent surveillance
```

---

## 🔥 Why ReID Is Important

Normal trackers like ByteTrack only maintain:

```text
Temporary Track IDs
```

Example:

```text
Track 1 → Track 17 → Track 43
```

when:

- worker turns
- occlusion happens
- person exits frame
- lighting changes
- motion blur occurs

This causes:

❌ Duplicate alerts  
❌ Broken identity tracking  
❌ Event fragmentation  
❌ Unstable monitoring

---

## ✅ Our Solution

The system now combines:

```text
ByteTrack + OSNet ReID
```

to create:

```text
Persistent Global Worker Identity
```

Example:

```text
Track 1
Track 17
Track 1000001
```

all become:

```text
gid_d074b67dab3d
```

This means:

✅ Same worker identity recovered  
✅ Stable event history  
✅ Enterprise-grade monitoring  
✅ Intelligent incident lifecycle

Persistent Global Identity
```

## 🔹 OSNet Feature Extractor

OSNet converts a person image into:

```text
Mathematical Appearance Embedding
```

It learns:

- clothing texture
- body shape
- appearance patterns
- visual identity
- color distribution

Example embedding:

```python
[0.172, -0.552, 0.913, ...]
```

---

## 🔹 Cosine Similarity Matching

Embeddings are compared using:

```text
Cosine Similarity
```

High similarity:

```text
Same worker
```

Low similarity:

```text
Different worker
```

---

## 🔹 Temporal Embedding Memory

The project includes:

```python
embedding_history = deque(maxlen=50)
```

This stabilizes identities across frames.

Benefits:

✅ Reduces identity switching  
✅ Handles webcam noise  
✅ Handles motion blur  
✅ Handles temporary occlusion

---

## 🔹 Unknown Counter Protection

The system prevents false identity creation.

Instead of:

```text
1 bad frame → new identity
```

it uses:

```text
multi-frame validation
```

This dramatically improves:

- identity consistency
- event reliability
- enterprise stability

---

# ✅ Association Layer (Human + PPE Logic)

The system intelligently associates PPE items with detected persons.

Instead of only detecting objects independently, the project:

1. Detects persons
2. Detects PPE objects
3. Matches PPE objects to nearby persons
4. Determines compliance status

### Example:

| Person | Helmet | Vest | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| Worker A | ❌ | ✅ | Violation |
| Worker B | ✅ | ✅ | Safe |

---

# ✅ ByteTrack Multi-Object Tracking

Each person receives a tracking ID.

### Benefits:

- Prevents duplicate alerts
- Tracks workers across frames
- Maintains temporal continuity
- Supports ReID recovery
- Improves event management

---

# ✅ Event Lifecycle Engine

The project includes enterprise event management.

### Event States

```text
NEW
 ↓
ACTIVE
 ↓
RESOLVED
 ↓
EXPIRED
```

This prevents:

❌ Alert flooding  
❌ Duplicate screenshots  
❌ Continuous repeated alerts

---

# ✅ Dashboard Analytics

Interactive dashboard showing:

- Total detections
- PPE compliance count
- Violations count
- Active streams
- Recent alerts
- Event history
- Live alert sidebar
- Stable worker identities
- Compliance trends

---

# ✅ Event Screenshot Storage

Whenever a PPE violation occurs:

- Screenshot captured automatically
- Event stored in SQLite database
- Timestamp recorded
- Compliance information saved
- Worker identity linked
- Evidence image generated

---

# ✅ RTSP / CCTV Support

Supports:

- CCTV Cameras
- IP Cameras
- Mobile IP Camera Apps
- RTSP Streams
- Webcam Devices

Example:

```bash
rtsp://username:password@ip:554/stream
```
